- 👋 Hi, I’m @Pencil-33
- 👀 I’m interested in developing basic coding skills. The last time I coded was with UNIX on Apollo workstations and Cobalt on Intel PC's at University in 1989 -so please go easy on me!
- 🌱 I’m currently thinking about developing scripts to stress test the world's only fully decentralised Knowledge Graph, The Orign Trail DKG, which is destined to take web3 to the moon! Check out: https://origintrail.io/
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with anyone who is kind enough to provide learning resources to get me started.
